This is a new project that I wanted to try. 

I wanted to make this Translate News web-app to possibly help people understand American news on the go.

This is an open source project and I am open to commiting code with pull requests. If anyone is interested in contributing to my project, please feel free 
to contact me anytime at henryhacker07@gmail.com to set up an agreement. 

Thank you everyone viewing and helping this project, I will keep posting updates and contributers to this README!
