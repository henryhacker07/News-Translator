This is a new project that I wanted to try!

I wanted to make this Translate News web-app to possibly help people understand American news on the go.

I am planning on using the MERN stack for this project and would prefer contributers that are experienced in React and Node.js as they 
will be the primary front-end and back-end technologies respectively. 

I am not decided on a language translating API yet, and am open to any suggestions! 

My goal once I am satisfied with the project is to deploy it on Heroku. 

This is an open source project and I am open to commiting code with verified pull requests. If anyone is interested in contributing to my project, please feel free 
to contact me anytime at henryhacker07@gmail.com to set up an agreement. 

Thank you everyone viewing and helping this project, I will keep posting updates and contributers to this README!
